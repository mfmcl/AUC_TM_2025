    "According to the literature, the most reliable features for SC are:\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Terms and their Frequency**: words or n-grams and their frequency. Raw counts, binary features or weighted counts (e.g., with TF-IDF) have been tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part-of-Speech tags**: soon enough it became evident that some PoS (expecially adjectives) are important indicators of subjectivity and opinion, so they should be treated as special features. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Opinion words and phrases**: some words or phrases have a strong connotation (i.e., they are regularly used to express a strong sentiment): e.g., *beautiful*, *amazing*, *terrible*. This is true also for noun and verbs (e.g., *crap*, *rubbish*, *hate*), and idioms (e.g. *what a trainwreck!*).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntactic dependency**: the syntactic relations in a sentence may be useful, e.g., to define the scope of an adjective (e.g., *amazing crap*) or of the negation (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Negation**: negation often reverse the polarity of an expression: \"I don’t like this camera\" is negative. However, negation itself has a scope and this rule has many possible exceptions: e.g., \"not only dumb but also boring\" is a case of negation that does not change the polarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Emoticons**: expecially when working with quickly written, informal text (e.g., tweets, SMSs, etc.) the presence and the polarity of an emoticon is a relevant feature for polarity classification."
